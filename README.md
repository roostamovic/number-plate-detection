<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]]

Automatic number-plate recognition is a technology that uses cascade classifiers on images to read vehicle registration plates to create vehicle location data. It can use existing closed-circuit television, road-rule enforcement cameras, or cameras specifically designed for the task.

<!-- Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template! -->

<!-- Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started. -->

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>



### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap your project. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples. -->

* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
<!-- ## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps. -->

### Prerequisites

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

Otherwise, you may install [Visual Studio COde](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to run and execute the code, but you should first have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your software.

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

<!-- 1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com) -->
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/roostamovic/number-plate-detection.git
   ```
2. Install required packages
   ```sh
   pip install opencv-python
   
   ```
3. Put your video link instead of 'a.mp4'
   ```py
   cap = cv2.VideoCapture('your_video.mp4')
   ```
